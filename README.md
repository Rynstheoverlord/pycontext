# This package is going to serve as a wrapper for pygame for building applications

# Widgets



# The TextButton
just as the name suggests, is a button that displays a text and triggers a particular event when clicked
 just like buttons are supposed to. 

-it takes ten arguments-



-- the surface to be blitted on
-- the text to be displayed on the button
-- the font size of the text
-- the color of the button
-- the text color
-- the x position
-- the y position
-- the width of the button
-- the height of the button
-- the associated command to be triggered on button press


# The ImageButton
just like the previous button is a button that rather than displaying a text, displays and image, it also takes a 
command and that command is executed on button press

-it takes seven arguments-


-- The surface to be blited on
-- the image you wish to display on the button
-- the x coordinate
-- the y coordinate
-- the width of the button
-- the button height
-- the command to be executed on button press
